## Note :memo:

2 Files has not been uploaded on GitHub Due to their large size.These Files Are =>
- Model(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CpwUtzJjgV2r8MTK4AgaGx_XuR8Cjhpi/view?usp=sharing);
- Tensorflow Dependency(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WnBBtb6vtaycBADmEU9ppx2vKYiyK0w7/view?usp=sharing);

## Instruction :pen:

- Create 'models' folder inside 'monkey' and paste the model there;
- Paste the TF Dependency in \Monkey\Lib\site-packages\tensorflow\python.

## About :memo:

This Project is a website to predict monkey breeds.There are a total of 10 breeds of monkeys.<br/>
 The Dataset has been taken from Kaggle.<br/>
 The size of the images was around 400x300 pixels and had around 1400 images.<br/>
Link = https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species<br/>
The predictions has been made using concepts of Deep Learning.<br/>
I have made use of Tensorflow Library.<br/>
Transfer Learning has proven to be a strong tool for classification purposes.Sophisticated deep learning models have millions of parameters (weights) and training them from scratch often requires large amounts of data of computing resources. Transfer learning is a technique that shortcuts much of this by taking a piece of a model that has already been trained on a related task and reusing it in a new model.<br/>
I have made use of Xception Model.<br/>
Xception by Google, stands for Extreme version of Inception, is reviewed. With a modified depthwise separable convolution, it is even better than Inception-v3 for both ImageNet ILSVRC and JFT datasets.<br/>
I have not trained the layers again apart from input and output layers.<br/>
The Output of Xception model has been furthur passed through a Flatten , Dense , Dropout and Dense Layer to remove Overfitting.<br/>
Apart from this to deal with Overfitting , I have preprocessed the images like rotation , width shift , height shift and horizontal flip.<br/>
The model was trained for 100 epochs and was able to achieve 91.62% train accuracy and 91.91% train accuracy.<br/>
The model was then saved and downloaded.<br/>
